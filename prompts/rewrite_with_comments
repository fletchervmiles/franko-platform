# Rewrite with comments

You are tasked with adding clear and concise comments to a piece of code. Your goal is to enhance the code's readability and understandability without altering its functionality. Follow these instructions carefully:

1. Guidelines for adding comments:
   - Add one comment per line of code, unless a line is trivial or closely related to the previous line.
   - Use simple, clear language and layman's terms where possible.
   - Keep comments succinct while still being informative.
   - Use inline comments (//) for all your explanations.

2. Your comments should explain:
   - What each line of code is doing
   - Why it matters in the context of the application
   - How it fits into the overall functionality

3. To complete this task:
   - Rewrite the entire code, adding your comments.
   - Place your comment for each line ABOVE the line it's describing.
   - Maintain the original indentation and structure of the code.
   - Do not alter the code in any way; only add comments.

Remember, your goal is to make the code more understandable without changing its functionality. Strive for a balance between providing helpful explanations and keeping the comments concise.
