# Link Feedback to Logged-in Users (Identity Verification)

With identity verification you can see *who* said what in your Franko dashboard. It does **not** change the visitor's experience – the modal looks identical whether the user is verified or anonymous.

---

## How it works

Add this snippet **before** your Franko embed script:

```html
<script>
// Replace the placeholder values with your own user data
window.FrankoUser = {
  user_id: CURRENT_USER_ID, // e.g. user.id, usually coming from your auth provider
  user_metadata: {
    name: CURRENT_USER_NAME,   // optional
    email: CURRENT_USER_EMAIL  // optional
  }
}
</script>
```

That's it! Franko will now associate feedback with this user.

## What data is stored?

- `user_id` - Your unique identifier for the user
- `user_metadata` - Only `name` and `email` (both optional)

---

## Common patterns

| Use case | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Show user info only when logged in | Wrap the snippet in your auth check |
| Different user data per page | Update `window.FrankoUser` dynamically |

---

## What if the snippet is missing?

No problem – conversations still work. The **User** column shows "Anonymous" instead of the user details.

## FAQ

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is this required? | No – skip it if anonymous feedback is fine |
| Does it work with Direct Links? | No – direct links open in new tabs without access to your session |
| Can I update user data dynamically? | Yes – set `window.FrankoUser` before calling `FrankoModal.open()` |
| Is HTTPS required? | Yes – always use HTTPS for security |
