<think>Let me create a detailed implementation plan that would help guide a junior developer through this project. I'll structure it with clear sections, file references, and technical considerations for each requirement.</think># Detailed Implementation Plan: Chat Completion Process Enhancement

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance the chat completion process in our platform. We're implementing several features to properly close, analyze, and present chat conversations, including transcript cleaning, completion status calculation, word counting, usage tracking, and summary generation.

---

## 1. Schema Updates (THIS IS ALREADY DONE)

### Required Database Schema Changes

Before implementation, we need to update the database schema to support our new features:

**File: `db/schema/chat-responses-schema.ts`**

Add the following fields to the `chatResponsesTable`:

```typescript
// Add these new fields
clean_transcript: text("clean_transcript"),
user_words: integer("user_words"),
transcript_summary: text("transcript_summary"),
```

**Technical Considerations:**
- These changes will require a database migration
- Ensure default values are provided for backward compatibility with existing records
- Add these fields to the `SelectChatResponse` and `InsertChatResponse` types

---

## 2. Finishing the Call

We need to implement two mechanisms to mark a conversation as completed:

### 2.1. Explicit Conversation Ending

**Files:**
- `app/(external-chat)/api/external-chat/route.ts` - Update the POST handler
- `components/external-chat.tsx` - Update the client-side end conversation logic

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Identify the current `endConversation` function in `external-chat.tsx`
2. Enhance it to make an API call to a new endpoint for finalizing conversations
3. Create a new API endpoint (e.g., `/api/external-chat/finalize`) that will:
   - Update the chat response with `interviewEndTime` and `totalInterviewMinutes`
   - Trigger the transcript cleaning process
   - Calculate completion status
   - Count user words
   - Generate the summary
   - Increment usage count if needed

**Technical Considerations:**
- Use a transaction to ensure all database updates are atomic
- Consider adding a confirmation dialog before ending the conversation
- Handle edge cases like network errors during finalization

### 2.2. Automatic Conversation Completion

**Files:**
- Create a new file: `app/api/cron/finalize-inactive-chats.ts`

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create a new API route that can be called by a cron job or scheduler
2. The route should:
   - Query for chat responses where:
     - `status` is not "completed"
     - `updatedAt` is more than 30 minutes ago
   - For each qualifying response, trigger the same finalization process as the explicit ending

**Technical Considerations:**
- Set up proper authentication for this endpoint (e.g., API key)
- Implement pagination if there could be many incomplete conversations
- Consider adding a `lastActivityAt` field to more accurately track inactivity
- Add logging for monitoring this background process

---

## 3. Cleaning up the Transcript

### 3.1. Transcript Cleaning Function

**Files:**
- Create a new utilities file: `lib/utils/transcript-cleaner.ts`

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create a function `cleanTranscript(messagesJson: string): string` that:
   - Parses the JSON string into a message array
   - Filters out messages with role "tool" or "system"
   - For each remaining message:
     - Format based on role (user vs assistant)
     - Handle content that could be string or array
     - For user messages, prefix with name (from `intervieweeFirstName`) or "Respondent"
     - For assistant messages, prefix with "Agent" or another appropriate title
     - Preserve markdown formatting
   - Join all formatted messages into a clean transcript string

**Example Input:**
```json
[
  {"id":"bbacdc63-e370-4961-a410-cb54d0c9724e","role":"user","content":"Hi, I'm ready!"},
  {"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Hey there! Thanks for taking the time to chat with me today."}]},
  {"role":"tool","content":"**Progress Update:**\n- Current Objective 1: Current (used: 1 | expected: 2â€“2 turns)\n","experimental_providerMetadata":{"metadata":{"type":"objective-update","isVisible":false}}}
]
```

**Example Output:**
```
Respondent: Hi, I'm ready!

Agent: Hey there! Thanks for taking the time to chat with me today.
```

**Technical Considerations:**
- Handle edge cases like empty messages, malformed JSON, etc.
- Consider using proper Typescript types for the message structure
- Implement unit tests for this critical function
- Handle multi-part messages correctly

### 3.2. Integration Points

This function will be called from:
- The explicit conversation ending API endpoint
- The automatic conversation completion process

---

## 4. Determining the Completion Status

### 4.1. Completion Status Calculation

**Files:**
- Create a new utilities file: `lib/utils/completion-calculator.ts`

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create a function `calculateCompletionStatus(chatProgress: any): string` that:
   - Validates the input structure
   - If invalid or missing, returns "n/a"
   - Counts the total number of objectives in `chatProgress.objectives`
   - For each objective, assigns a completion value:
     - "complete" = 100%
     - "current" = 50%
     - "tbc" = 0%
   - Calculates the average percentage across all objectives
   - Returns the percentage as a string (e.g., "30%")

**Example Input:**
```json
{
  "objectives": {
    "objective01": {
      "status": "complete",
      "turns_used": 0,
      "expected_max": 2,
      "expected_min": 2
    },
    "objective02": {
      "status": "current",
      "turns_used": 0,
      "expected_max": 3,
      "expected_min": 3
    },
    "objective03": {
      "status": "tbc",
      "turns_used": 0,
      "expected_max": 3,
      "expected_min": 3
    }
  },
  "overall_turns": 0,
  "expected_total_max": 8,
  "expected_total_min": 8
}
```

**Example Output:**
```
"50%"
```

**Technical Considerations:**
- Handle edge cases like missing fields or malformed JSON
- Consider returning both a numeric value and a formatted string
- Validate that the objective statuses match expected values

### 4.2. Integration Points

This function will be called from:
- The explicit conversation ending API endpoint
- The automatic conversation completion process

---

## 5. Word Count

### 5.1. User Word Counting Function

**Files:**
- Create a new utilities file: `lib/utils/word-counter.ts`

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create a function `countUserWords(messagesJson: string): number` that:
   - Parses the JSON string into a message array
   - Filters for messages with role "user"
   - For each user message:
     - Extract the content (handling both string and array formats)
     - Count words using a regex like `/\S+/g`
   - Return the total word count

**Technical Considerations:**
- Handle edge cases like empty messages or malformed JSON
- Consider how to count words in structured content
- Implement unit tests for this function

### 5.2. Integration Points

This function will be called from:
- The explicit conversation ending API endpoint
- The automatic conversation completion process

---

## 6. Counting Usage

### 6.1. Usage Tracking Function

**Files:**
- Create a new utilities file: `lib/utils/usage-tracker.ts`

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create a function `updateUsageCount(userId: string, completionRate: number): Promise<void>` that:
   - Checks if `completionRate` is > 50%
   - If true, increments the `total_responses_used_this_month` field for the given user
   - If false, does nothing

**Technical Considerations:**
- Use a transaction to ensure atomic updates
- Add error handling in case the user profile doesn't exist
- Consider adding logging for usage tracking

### 6.2. Integration Points

This function will be called from:
- The explicit conversation ending API endpoint
- The automatic conversation completion process

---

## 7. Summary Generation

### 7.1. Summary Generation Function

**Files:**
- Create a new utilities file: `lib/utils/summary-generator.ts`
- Ensure the prompt file exists: `agent_prompts/transcript_summary.md` (the contents will be added later)

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create a function `generateSummary(cleanTranscript: string, conversationPlan: string): Promise<string>` that:
   - Skips execution if the completion rate is 0%
   - Reads the prompt template from `transcript_summary.md`
   - Replaces placeholders with the provided `clean_transcript` and `conversation_plan`
   - Makes an API call to Gemini Pro
   - If that fails, tries Gemini Flash
   - Returns the generated summary or an error message

**Technical Considerations:**
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Consider adding timeout and retry logic
- Handle token limits for very long transcripts
- Cache the prompt template to avoid reading from disk on every call

### 7.2. Integration Points

This function will be called from:
- The explicit conversation ending API endpoint
- The automatic conversation completion process

---

## 8. API Integration

### 8.1. Conversation Finalization Function

**Files:**
- Create a new utilities file: `lib/utils/conversation-finalizer.ts`

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create a function `finalizeConversation(chatResponseId: string): Promise<void>` that:
   - Fetches the chat response record from the database
   - Fetches the associated chat instance for the conversation plan
   - Sets the `interviewEndTime` to the current time
   - Calculates `totalInterviewMinutes` based on start and end times
   - Calls the transcript cleaning function and updates `clean_transcript`
   - Calls the completion status calculation function and updates `completionStatus`
   - Calls the word counting function and updates `user_words`
   - Calls the usage tracking function if completion rate > 50%
   - If completion rate > 0%, calls the summary generation function and updates `transcript_summary`
   - Updates the chat response with all new values

**Technical Considerations:**
- Use a transaction to ensure all updates are atomic
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement detailed logging
- Consider making some steps asynchronous if they're time-consuming

### 8.2. API Endpoints

**Files:**
- Create a new API endpoint: `app/api/external-chat/finalize/route.ts`
- Update existing file: `app/(external-chat)/api/external-chat/route.ts`

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create the new API endpoint that:
   - Receives a POST request with a `chatResponseId`
   - Validates the input
   - Calls the `finalizeConversation` function
   - Returns a success or error response

2. Update the existing POST endpoint to:
   - Recognize an `endConversation` action
   - Call the finalization endpoint when the conversation ends

**Technical Considerations:**
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Add validation for input parameters
- Consider rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Add detailed error handling

---

## 9. Frontend Integration

### 9.1. ConversationPageClient Component Update

**Files:**
- Update: `components/conversation-page-client.tsx`

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Update the data fetching logic to:
   - Include the new fields (clean_transcript, completion_status, user_words, transcript_summary)
   - Format the data to match the expected UI component props
   - Sort conversations with most recent first

2. Pass the correct data to the child components:
   - Map `user_words` to `customerWords`
   - Map `completion_status` to `completionRate` (convert to number)
   - Map `transcript_summary` to `summary`
   - Map `clean_transcript` to `transcript`

**Technical Considerations:**
- Ensure data types match between backend and frontend
- Handle loading and error states appropriately
- Consider adding pagination for performance

### 9.2. ResponseCardList Component

**Files:**
- No changes needed, as long as data is formatted correctly by parent component

### 9.3. ResponseCard Component

**Files:**
- No changes needed, as long as data is formatted correctly by parent component

**Technical Considerations:**
- Ensure all properties in the `Response` interface are correctly populated
- Test with different completion rates and transcript formats

## 11. Deployment Considerations


### 11.2. API Key for Gemini

Ensure API keys are properly configured:
1. Gemini Pro API key
2. Gemini Flash API key (backup)

### 11.3. Cron Job Setup

Set up a scheduled job to run the inactive chat finalization:
1. Configure to run every 5-15 minutes
2. Set up monitoring and alerting
3. Implement logging for debugging

---

## 12. Monitoring and Logging

### 12.1. Key Metrics

Monitor:
1. Conversation completion rates
2. Word counts
3. Summary generation success rate
4. Auto-finalization counts

### 12.2. Error Tracking

Log errors for:
1. Failed transcript cleaning
2. Summary generation failures
3. Database update errors

---

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for enhancing our chat completion process. By following these steps, we'll ensure that conversations are properly closed, analyzed, and presented to users, improving the overall user experience and data quality.

## Initial Requirements Discussion

This was an initial discuss to clarify the requirements. Use it as a reference point.

Product Manager: 

I have a few requirements I want to add and I want you to help me... First, can you review these files. 

Agent: 

I've reviewed the attached files. Here's a brief overview of each:

1. **`app/conversations/[guideName]/page.tsx`**: This file handles the conversation page, dynamically importing the `ConversationPageClient` component and managing user authentication. If the user is not authenticated, it redirects to the sign-in page.

2. **`app/api/external-chat/progress/route.ts`**: This API route retrieves the progress status of an external chat session. It validates the chat response ID, retrieves the chat response from the database, parses the chat progress, and returns a sanitized response with cache control headers.

3. **`app/(external-chat)/api/external-chat/route.ts`**: This file manages chat-related API endpoints, including processing new messages and tool executions. It handles AI processing, tool execution, and streaming responses, with a focus on error handling and logging.

4. **`app/chat/external/[id]/finish/page.tsx`**: This component displays a thank-you page after a chat session, fetching chat instance data and showing a confetti effect. It also provides a copy-to-clipboard feature for incentive codes.

5. **`app/chat/external/[id]/active/loading.tsx`**: A simple loading component that displays a spinner and a loading message.

6. **`app/chat/external/[id]/active/page.tsx`**: This component handles the active chat page, prefetching user data and warming up the prompt cache. It uses the `OptimizedChatLoader` component for lazy loading.

7. **`app/chat/external/[id]/page.tsx`**: This component manages the start chat page, fetching chat instance data and initializing the chat session. It handles user input and navigation to the active chat page.

8. **`components/external-chat.tsx`**: This client component manages the main chat interface for external users, handling chat state, rendering messages, and processing AI responses. It also manages navigation to the completion page and shows progress indicators.

9. **`db/schema/chat-instances-schema.ts`**: Defines the schema for the `chat_instances` table, including fields for user ID, messages, conversation plan, and various metadata.

10. **`db/schema/chat-responses-schema.ts`**: Defines the schema for the `chat_responses` table, including fields for user ID, chat instance ID, completion status, and chat progress.

11. **`db/schema/profiles-schema.ts`**: Defines the schema for the `profiles` table, including fields for user ID, email, organization details, and membership information.

12. **`components/conversation-page-client.tsx`**: This component manages the conversation page client-side, handling tab navigation, conversation plan loading, and user interactions like renaming or deleting conversations.

13. **`components/conversation-responses.tsx`**: This component displays an overview of conversation responses, including response count, total customer words, and completion rate. It uses the `ResponseCard` component to display individual responses.

If you have specific requirements or changes you'd like to make, please let me know!

Product Manager: 

Ok, don't write any code yet. Help me think through my requirements. I want to do the following:

**Finishing the call**
- When chat response ends, i.e. when endConversation is initiated, I want to trigger a bunch of actions to save the chat conversation
- I also need to figure out stratetgy for triggering this process when the endConversation is never called, i.e. when the conversation is only partially complete. This could be a timing delay from the last message received or something like that?

**Cleaning up the transcript**
- One of the things to do will be to clean up the messages_json text in @chat-responses-schema.ts to pull out the agent text and the user text and then save it in the same schema under clean_transcript field. This is the format of the messages_json text

[{"id":"bbacdc63-e370-4961-a410-cb54d0c9724e","role":"user","content":"Hi, I'm ready!"},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Hey there! Thanks for taking the time to chat with me today. We're hoping to get your feedback on Clerk.com, specifically your onboarding experience and how you're using its features. Sound good?\n"}]},{"role":"tool","content":"**Progress Update:**\n- Current Objective 1: Current (used: 1 | expected: 2â€“2 turns)\n","experimental_providerMetadata":{"metadata":{"type":"objective-update","isVisible":false}}}]

It should be saved similar to the placeholder transcript text in @conversation-page-client.tsx . With the name if we have it with "Respondent" if we don't have it. 

**Determining the completion status**
- We also want to add a function that extracts the chat_progress JSON field from the @chat-responses-schema.ts and looks at the status of the objectives to determine a completion_status (to be saved in the completion_status field of the @chat-responses-schema.ts . The JSON object looks like this:

{
  "objectives": {
    "objective01": {
      "status": "complete",
      "turns_used": 0,
      "expected_max": 2,
      "expected_min": 2
    },
    "objective02": {
      "status": "current",
      "turns_used": 0,
      "expected_max": 3,
      "expected_min": 3
    },
    "objective03": {
      "status": "tbc",
      "turns_used": 0,
      "expected_max": 3,
      "expected_min": 3
    },
    "objective04": {
      "status": "tbc",
      "turns_used": 0,
      "expected_max": 2,
      "expected_min": 2
    },
    "objective05": {
      "status": "tbc",
      "turns_used": 0,
      "expected_max": 2,
      "expected_min": 2
    }
  },
  "overall_turns": 0,
  "expected_total_max": 12,
  "expected_total_min": 12
}

We want to use the total objectives plus their status to determine a completion score. So for this there's 5 objectives. 1 is 100% complete and one is 50% completion. So total completion score would be 30%. 

Completion = 100% complete
CURRENT = 50% complete
TBC = 0% complete 

**Word Count**
- We want to extract from the messages_json or from the new clean_transcript a count for the number of customer / user words. So only the words that were given by the customer themselves... we want a function to extract this and save it in the "user_words" field of the @chat-responses-schema.ts.

**Counting Usage**
- Ok, if the completion rate is above 50%, I also want to count it by incrementing by 1 the "total_responses_used_this_month" field in the @profiles-schema.ts. 

**Summary**
- I also want to run a request that includes the inclusion of variables for new clean_transcript (from the @chat-responses-schema.ts ) and the original conversation_plan (from the@chat-instances-schema.ts ). The request should be to Gemini (start with GeminiPro and if there's an error, use GeminiFlash). This information should be saved in @chat-responses-schema.ts in the field "transcript_summary". And the prompt it will use is - C:\Users\fletc\Desktop\franko-platform\agent_prompts\transcript_summary.md

**Saving to the frontend**
Finally, at the end of all of these... they should be saved on the frontend user profile, similiar to how the mock data appears now in @conversation-page-client.tsx.

Let's start there. Don't write any code. Talk me through these requirements. Ask 10 or more clarifying questions.

Agent: 

# Requirements Analysis

You've outlined several requirements for enhancing your chat platform's conversation completion process. Let me break down my understanding of each requirement and ask clarifying questions.

## Finishing the Call

You want to trigger a series of actions when a conversation ends, either through an explicit `endConversation` call or through a timeout mechanism when the conversation is abandoned.

**Clarifying Questions:**
1. Where is the `endConversation` function currently defined and called? Is it in the `external-chat.tsx` component?
2. What's your current timeout strategy for inactive conversations? Do you have any existing mechanism to detect abandoned conversations?
3. What's an appropriate timeout period for considering a conversation abandoned? (30 minutes, 1 hour, 24 hours?)
4. Should partially completed conversations be marked differently in the database compared to explicitly ended ones?
5. Do you want to send any notification to users when their conversation is auto-completed due to inactivity?

## Cleaning up the Transcript

You want to extract and format the conversation from the `messages_json` field into a cleaner transcript format, separating agent and user messages.

**Clarifying Questions:**
6. Should system messages or tool messages (like the "Progress Update" in your example) be included in the clean transcript or filtered out?
7. How should we handle multi-part messages (where content is an array of objects with different types)?
8. Do you want to preserve any formatting or markdown in the messages?
9. Should we include timestamps for each message in the clean transcript?
10. For the user name, should we prioritize using `intervieweeFirstName` from the chat response, or is there another field we should check first?

## Determining the Completion Status

You want to calculate a completion percentage based on the objectives' statuses in the `chat_progress` field.

**Clarifying Questions:**
11. Should we weight objectives differently based on their `expected_min` or `expected_max` values, or treat all objectives equally?
12. How should we handle cases where the `chat_progress` field is missing or malformed?
13. Should we store both the raw percentage (e.g., 30%) and a categorical status (e.g., "Partially Complete") in the `completion_status` field?
14. Is there a minimum completion threshold below which you'd consider the conversation invalid or unusable?
15. Should we consider `turns_used` in our calculation, or just the status values?

## Word Count

You want to count the number of words contributed by the user/customer.

**Clarifying Questions:**
16. How should we handle non-text content from users (if any), such as uploaded files or structured data?
17. Should we exclude certain types of user messages (like single-word responses or greetings) from the word count?
18. Do you want to track word counts per objective or just the total?
19. Should we also track the AI assistant's word count for comparison?
20. How should we handle edge cases like code snippets or lists in user messages?

## Counting Usage

You want to increment a usage counter when the completion rate exceeds 50%.

**Clarifying Questions:**
21. Should we also track partial usage for conversations below the 50% threshold?
22. Do you want to implement any rate limiting or quota enforcement based on these usage counts?
23. Should we reset the monthly counter automatically at the start of each month?
24. Do you want to notify users when they're approaching their usage limits?
25. Should we have different thresholds for different membership tiers?

## Summary Generation

You want to generate a summary of the conversation using Gemini AI.

**Clarifying Questions:**
26. What's the content of the `transcript_summary.md` prompt file? Can you share its structure?
27. Should the summary have a character or word limit?
28. Do you want to include any metadata in the summary (like completion rate, duration, etc.)?
29. Should we retry with a different model if Gemini fails, or just log the error?
30. How should we handle very short conversations that might not need summarization?

## Saving to the Frontend

You want all this data to be accessible in the frontend user profile.

**Clarifying Questions:**
31. Are there any specific UI components that need to be updated to display this new data?
32. Should we implement any real-time updates for ongoing conversations?
33. Do you want to implement any sorting or filtering options for the conversation list based on these new metrics?
34. Should we add any visualization for completion rates or word counts?
35. Are there any performance concerns with loading potentially large transcript data in the frontend?

These questions should help clarify your requirements before we start implementing the solutions. Would you like to address any of these questions or provide additional context?

Product Manager:

1. it's currently in @route.ts which then interacts with @external-chat.tsx 
2. I don't have an existing mechanism
3. There's a field "updated_at" in the chat-response-schema, 30 minutes after that has last been updated would be a good time to automatically wrap things up
4. They will be as part of the completion_status field
5. no

6. No, they should be filtered out
7. If it's part of the frontend conversation, include it
8. Yes
9. No
10. Yes

11. Treat them equally
12. Just put a n/a
13. just the raw is fine
14. if it's 0% completed, we shouldn't save it on the frontend, i.e. at that point it's invalid and unusable
15. No

16. Ignore this for now - focus on words only
17.  No
18. Just the total
19. No 
20. No, just focus on the words

21. No
22. I do but I will do that as part of a seperate implementation so ignore that for now and focus on collecting the value
23. Ignore this for now
24. Ignore this for now
25. Ignore this for now

26. Right now it's empty but it will be a prompt and it will need to be populated with {conversation_plan} and {clean_transcript}
27. Don't worry about that for now
28. No
29. Log the error
30. Don't request a summary if completion is 0%

31. Yes, please look into this - the main starting point is @conversation-page-client.tsx 
32. No
33. No, they should just appear as most recent first
34. This exists already on the existing components - the UI work has been done so we just need to identify the right components like @conversation-page-client.tsx , @response-card-list.tsx , @response-card.tsx , etc.
35. No, these transcripts won't be that large

Agent:

Thank you for the detailed responses. I now have a clearer understanding of your requirements. Let me outline a high-level implementation plan based on your answers:

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Finishing the Call

We'll need to implement two mechanisms:
- Handle the explicit `endConversation` call in `route.ts` and `external-chat.tsx`
- Create a background process or API endpoint that checks for inactive conversations (where `updated_at` is more than 30 minutes old) and triggers the same completion process

### 2. Cleaning up the Transcript

We'll create a function that:
- Parses the `messages_json` field
- Filters out system messages and tool messages
- Formats user and assistant messages into a clean transcript
- Uses `intervieweeFirstName` when available, otherwise uses "Respondent"
- Preserves formatting and markdown in messages
- Handles multi-part messages appropriately

### 3. Determining the Completion Status

We'll implement a function that:
- Calculates completion percentage based on objectives' statuses
- Treats all objectives equally (complete = 100%, current = 50%, tbc = 0%)
- Handles missing or malformed `chat_progress` with "n/a"
- Stores the raw percentage in the `completion_status` field
- Flags conversations with 0% completion as invalid

### 4. Word Count

We'll create a function that:
- Counts words in user messages only
- Ignores non-text content
- Stores the total in the `user_words` field

### 5. Counting Usage

We'll implement logic that:
- Increments `total_responses_used_this_month` in the user's profile when completion rate > 50%

### 6. Summary Generation

We'll create a function that:
- Skips summarization for 0% complete conversations
- Uses Gemini Pro to generate a summary based on the clean transcript and conversation plan
- Falls back to Gemini Flash if Pro fails
- Logs errors if both models fail
- Stores the summary in the `transcript_summary` field

### 7. Saving to the Frontend

We'll ensure that:
- The data is properly formatted for the existing UI components
- The components in `conversation-page-client.tsx`, `response-card-list.tsx`, and `response-card.tsx` display the new data
- Conversations are sorted with most recent first

## Implementation Considerations

Based on the files you've shared, I can see that:

1. The `chatResponsesTable` schema needs to be updated to include fields for:
   - `clean_transcript`
   - `user_words`
   - `transcript_summary`

2. The existing UI components (`ResponseCard`, `ResponseCardList`) already have fields for:
   - `name`
   - `email`
   - `completionRate`
   - `completionDate`
   - `summary`
   - `transcript`
   - `customerWords`

This means we need to ensure our backend processing creates data in the format expected by these components.

## Next Steps

1. Update the `chatResponsesTable` schema to include the new fields
2. Implement the conversation completion logic (both explicit and timeout-based)
3. Create the transcript cleaning function
4. Implement the completion status calculation
5. Add the word count function
6. Add the usage counting logic
7. Implement the summary generation
8. Connect the backend data to the frontend components

Would you like me to start implementing any specific part of this plan? Or do you have any additional questions or adjustments before we begin?
