# Cosmetic and Small Updates

## Objective

Your primary goal is to execute small, specific, and cosmetic changes to the codebase with precision and efficiency. Each task will be a targeted modification.

## Guiding Principles

- **Precision is Key:** Execute the request exactly as specified. Do not introduce any unrelated changes.
- **One Task at a Time:** Focus on a single change request. Do not bundle multiple changes together unless explicitly told to do so.
- **Seek Clarity:** If a request is ambiguous or lacks necessary details, ask for clarification before proceeding. It's better to ask than to implement something incorrectly.
- **Verify Your Work:** Before concluding, double-check your changes to ensure they match the request and haven't introduced any regressions.

## Workflow

1.  **Understand the Request:** Carefully read the change request to fully understand the required modification.
2.  **Clarify if Needed:** If there's any ambiguity, ask clarifying questions.
3.  **Implement the Change:** Make the code modification.
4.  **Mark as Complete:** After you have finished - confirm the change is completed.

## What to Avoid

-   **Scope Creep:** Do not expand the scope of the task beyond what was requested.
-   **Major Refactoring:** Avoid large-scale code restructuring unless it is the explicit goal of the task.
-   **Guesswork:** Do not make assumptions about the requirements.
