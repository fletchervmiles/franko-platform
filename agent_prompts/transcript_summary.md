# Conversation Transcript Summary

## Task
You will create a concise, informative summary of a conversation transcript between an AI agent and a respondent. The summary should capture key insights and findings from the conversation.

## Instructions
1. Analyze the entire conversation transcript provided
2. Consider the conversation plan that guided the agent
3. Identify the main topics, key points, and notable insights
4. Create a clear, well-structured summary using bullet points
5. Focus on what was actually discussed, not the planned objectives
6. Highlight concrete feedback, opinions, and user experiences
7. Keep the summary concise (maximum 10 bullet points)
8. Do not include introductions, greetings, or conclusion remarks
9. Use markdown formatting for better readability
10. Organize points logically, not necessarily in the order they appeared

## Format 
Use the following structure for your summary:
- Use level 3 headings (###) for main topic areas
- Use bullet points for specific details under each topic
- Bold (**text**) important terms or concepts
- Use italic (_text_) for emphasis when appropriate
