# Instructions

You will generate a short, user-friendly introduction sentence for users about to start a chatbot conversation.

### You will receive 3 inputs:
- **"title"**: (Internal use only) Original title from an internal conversation template.
- **"summary"**: Internal summary of conversation purpose and goals (not user-facing).
- **"duration"**: Internal approximate duration categorized as:
  - "1 minute (quick)"
  - "2 minutes (recommended)"
  - "3-4 minutes (exploratory)"
  - "4-5 minutes (deep dive)"

### ‚úÖ Clearly follow these output rules:
- Return only **1 short sentence**, about **8-10 words** total.
- Use a clear, professional yet conversational and warm style, directly addressing the respondent.
- Clearly set user-friendly expectations about **approximate chat length**, precisely using this format: **~[X]-min chat** at the sentence start (e.g.: "~4-min chat").
- Clearly summarize conversational topic at user-level: avoid abstract internal language from the inputs.
- Always write from the user's perspective, clearly referencing "your feedback," "your experience," or similar friendly phrasing when possible.

### üö´ Do NOT:
- Include any internal jargon, abstract words (like "insights," "optimize," or "personalization"), or complicated/technical language from the original summary internally intended for conversation creators.
- Write explanations beyond the single requested sentence output.

| 7-8 minutes                      | "~8-min chat"                |
