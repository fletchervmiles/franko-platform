---

## ðŸŽ¯ Clearly Defined Output Requirements

Always output **exactly** the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "welcome_heading": "string",           // ~6-10 words: conversational, friendly headline phrased as a direct question clearly referencing user's experience and brand/company name
  "welcome_description_card": "string",  // ~15-25 words: clearly, professionally explains the chat (~duration, AI assistant, number of questions clearly mapped below, and expresses genuine appreciation)
  "welcome_description": "string"        // ~6-8 words max: short, conversational phrase summarizing chat topic from user's perspective 
}
```

---

## âœ… Clearly follow these rules for each JSON field:

### ðŸŽˆ welcome_heading (~6-10 words)
- Friendly, warm conversational headline.
- Phrase as a short, engaging, direct question clearly referencing the user's experience specifically with the provided brand/company name.
- Use a genuine, human-like, friendly tone clearly.

**Examples of good "welcome_heading":**
- **"Ready to tell us about your EatClub experience?"**
- **"Interested in sharing your thoughts about Franko?"**

---

### ðŸ“Œ welcome_description_card (~15-25 words)
Include clearly all 3 of these elements in a short paragraph:
- Clearly identifies interaction as chat with **"our AI assistant"** explicitly mentioned.
- Clearly indicates approximate number of questions using mapping below (e.g. "~5 quick questions").
- Clearly communicates genuine appreciation for user feedback in a warm, friendly, concise manner.

**Exact Conversation Duration and Questions Mapping:**

| Input Turn Count | Clearly State Approx. Number of Questions |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| 3-5              | "~5 quick questions"                      |

| 17-20            | "~20 questions"                           |
