# Link Feedback to Logged-in Users (Identity Verification)

With identity verification you can see *who* said what in your Franko dashboard. It does **not** change the visitor's experience – the modal looks identical whether the user is verified or anonymous.

---

## How it works

Add this snippet **before** your Franko embed script:

```html
<script>
// Replace the placeholder values with your own user data
window.FrankoUser = {
  user_id: YOUR_CURRENT_USER_ID, // e.g. user.id, usually from your auth provider
  user_metadata: {
    name: YOUR_CURRENT_USER_NAME,   // optional
    email: YOUR_CURRENT_USER_EMAIL  // optional
  }
}
</script>
```

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Script Order Matters**
> 
> The `window.FrankoUser` identity snippet must be executed **before** the main Franko embed script loads, otherwise user data will be missed.
> 
> **Reliable Pattern**: Place the identity information in the same script tag as your Franko loader to guarantee correct order:
> 
> ```html
> <script>
> (function() {
>   // 1. Set user identity first
>   window.FrankoUser = {
>     user_id: "user-123",
>     user_metadata: { name: "Ada Lovelace", email: "ada@example.com" }
>   };
> 
>   // 2. Then load Franko embed script
>   if (!window.FrankoModal) {
>     window.FrankoModal = (...a) => { /* ...Franko loader code... */ };
>     // ...rest of your Franko embed code...
>   }
> })();
> </script>
> ```

That's it! Franko will now associate feedback with this user.

## What data is stored?

- `user_id` - Your unique identifier for the user
- `user_metadata` - Only `name` and `email` (both optional)

---

## Common patterns

| Use case | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Show user info only when logged in | Wrap the snippet in your auth check |
| Different user data per page | Update `window.FrankoUser` dynamically |

**Compatible with all embedding methods**: This identity pattern works with both [Chat Bubbles](./chat-bubble) and [Custom Triggers](./custom-trigger).

---

## What if the snippet is missing?

No problem – conversations still work. The **User** column shows "Anonymous" instead of the user details.

## FAQ

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is this required? | No – skip it if anonymous feedback is fine |
| Does it work with Direct Links? | No – direct links open in new tabs without access to your session |
| Can I update user data dynamically? | Yes – set `window.FrankoUser` before calling `FrankoModal.open()` |
| Is HTTPS required? | Yes – always use HTTPS for security |
