# Shareable Links

Every Franko modal is automatically available as a standalone webpage that you can share anywhere. This is perfect for situations where you can't embed a script or want to send direct feedback links.

---

## How it works

Simply use this URL structure with your modal slug:

```
https://franko.ai/embed/YOUR_MODAL_SLUG
```

The modal opens in a new browser tab as a standalone page, no embedding required.

## Limitations

**No identity verification**: Since shareable links open in a new tab without access to your website's session, the `window.FrankoUser` identity snippet cannot be used. All feedback will appear as "Anonymous" in your dashboard.

**No customization**: The modal appears with its default styling and cannot be customized via CSS or JavaScript like embedded versions.

## When to use shareable links vs embedding

| Use shareable links when: | Use embedding when: |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Sending via email, chat, or social media | Building feedback into your website |
| You can't add JavaScript to the page | You want to identify users |
| Creating QR codes or printed materials | You need custom styling or behavior |
| External platforms (GitHub, Slack, etc.) | Contextual triggers (after form submission, etc.) |

## FAQ

**Can I track who submitted feedback via shareable links?** Not automatically, but you can ask users to include their email in the feedback itself.

**Do shareable links expire?** No, they remain active as long as your modal is active.

**Can I customize the appearance of shareable link modals?** No, they use the default Franko styling. For customization, use [embedded modals](./custom-trigger) instead.
