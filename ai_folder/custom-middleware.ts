// Import the experimental middleware type from the Vercel AI SDK
// This type defines the structure for intercepting and modifying AI model interactions
import { Experimental_LanguageModelV1Middleware } from "ai";

// Currently, this is an empty middleware implementation
// It's not doing anything yet, but it's ready to be configured with middleware functions
// Potential uses could include:
// - Logging requests and responses
// - Modifying prompts before they reach the AI model
// - Transforming AI responses before they reach the application
// - Adding caching or rate limiting
// - Implementing security checks or content filtering
